			<h1>Introduction to JavaScript: 2</h1>

			<h2>What is DOM Scripting?</h2>

			<p>Most of what we have been doing with JavaScript so far could most accurately be described as <i>DOM Scripting</i>. The DOM, or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model">Document Object Model</a>, is a conceptual model of the document (web page). Essentially it is a heirarchical model of the document markup and content where each HTML element forms a <i>node</i>.</p>
			<p>Like many other aspects of the Web, the DOM is maintained by the W3C, and all browsers use the same standard DOM. This means we can use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM (e.g. add and modify elements and content), knowing that what we do will work exactly the same in all browsers.</p>
			<p>For example, if we decide that we need to add a new class (or any other attribute) to an unordered list, or if we need to create a new unordered list, the same script that makes that happen will work just as well in Firefox as it will in Chrome or Edge. It wasn't always so simple, but that's another story.</p>
			<p>Although JavaScript can do many things, in front-end development it is most commonly used for DOM Scripting. Over the years it has developed some very powerful tools that help us manipulate the DOM and that make it easy. For example, HTML elements can be selected in JavaScript using the same selection syntax as they can in CSS, using the <i><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector">document.querySelector()</a></i> method. It was introduced in 2013 and <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=querySelector">browser support</a> is excellent.</p>
