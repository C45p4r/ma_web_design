			<h2>Basic Principles</h2>
			<p>In content strategy, there is no playbook of generic strategies you can pick from to assemble a plan for your client or project. Instead, our discipline rests on a series of core principles about what makes content effective&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;what makes it work, what makes it good. The first section of this book is organized around these fundamentals.</p>

			<h3>Good Content is Appropriate</h3>
			<p>Publish content that is right for the user and for the business</p>
        
			<p>There's really only one central principle of good content: it should be appropriate for your business, for your users, and for its context. Appropriate in its method of delivery, in its style and structure, and above all in its substance. Content strategy is the practice of determining what each of those things means for your project&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;and how to get there from where you are now.</p>

			<h4>Right for the user (and context)</h4>
        	<p>Let us meditate for a moment on James Bond. Clever and tough as he is, he'd be mincemeat a hundred times over if not for the hyper-competent support team that stands behind him. When he needs to chase a villain, the team summons an Aston Martin DB 5. When he's poisoned by a beautiful woman with dubious connections, the team offers the antidote in a spring-loaded, space-age infusion device. When he emerges from a swamp overrun with trained alligators, it offers a shower, a shave, and a perfectly tailored suit. It does not talk down to him or waste his time. It anticipates his needs, but does not offer him everything he might ever need, all the time.</p>
        
			<p>Content is appropriate for users when it helps them accomplish their goals.</p>

			<p>Content is <em>perfectly</em> appropriate for users when it makes them feel like geniuses on critically important missions, offering them precisely what they need, exactly when they need it, and in just the right form. All of this requires that you get pretty deeply into your users' heads, if not their tailoring specifications.</p>
        
			<p>Part of this mind-reading act involves context, which encompasses quite a lot more than just access methods, or even a fine-grained understanding of user goals. Content strategist Daniel Eizans has suggested that a meaningful analysis of a user's context requires not only an understanding of users' goals, but also of their behaviors: What are they doing? How are they feeling? What are they capable of? </p>
        
			<p>It's a sensible notion. When I call the emergency room on a weekend, my context is likely to be quite different than when I call my allergy specialist during business hours. If I look at a subway map at 3:00am, chances are that I need to know which trains are running now, not during rush hour tomorrow. When I look up your company on my phone, I'm more likely to need basic contact info than your annual report from 2006. But assumptions about reader context&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;however well researched&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;will never be perfect. Always give readers the option of seeing more information if they wish to do so.</p>
        	
        	<h4>Right for the business</h4>
			<p>Content is appropriate for your business when it helps you accomplish your business goals in a sustainable way.</p>

			<p>Business goals include things like &ldquo;increase sales&rdquo;, &ldquo;improve technical support service,&rdquo; and &ldquo;reduce printing costs for educational materials,&rdquo; and the trick is to accomplish those goals using sustainable processes. Sustainable content is content you can create&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;and maintain&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;without going broke, without lowering quality in ways that make the content suck, and without working employees into nervous breakdowns. The need for this kind of sustainability may sound boneheadedly obvious, but it's very easy to create an ambitious plan for publishing oodles of content without considering the long-term effort required to manage it.</p>

			<p>Fundamentally, though, &ldquo;right for the business&rdquo; and &ldquo;right for the user&rdquo; are the same thing. Without readers, viewers, and listeners, all content is meaningless, and content created without consideration for users' needs harms publishers because ignored users leave.</p>

			<p>This principle boils down to enlightened self interest: that which hurts your users hurts you.</p>
