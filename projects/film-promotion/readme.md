# Projects 

Select a film—released before 2005, ie older than 15 years—and create promotional web campaign to announce the opening of the first showing at a local venue.

As part of the publicity team for a new release, your job is to promote your chosen film by designing a promotional website, with the optional addition of a poster, to draw people away from their home screens and back into the cinema to enjoy the big screen. Use this project as a way to make a statement – either to bring back memories (for film classics or an older audience) or to generate curiosity (for newer or alternative films).
