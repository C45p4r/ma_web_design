      <h3 class="sub-title"> General description </h3>
      <div class="description">
        <p> The picture is showing a portable desk fan made in Japan.  Most part of the fan is made of plastics with rounded edges from top to bottom.  The fan is around the size of two adult hands added together of both its height and width. </p> <p> Other than the fact that it is easy-to-carry and light in weight, there are serval details I have observed: </p>

        <img class="photo" src="../img/object3-2-c1.jpg" alt="portable desk fan - adjustable body part" />
      <h3 class="sub-title"> Adjustable body part </h3>
      <div class="description">
        <p> With the U-shaped part that fixes the fan, the body part can be freely adjusted up to 270 degrees with small intermediate stops in-between.  There will be a "tick" sound when it was being adjusted that gives the user a single that the fan is fixed at a certain position, which I think is an intended feature for us to keep track of the status of the fan. </p>

        <img class="photo" src="../img/object3-3-c1.jpg" alt="portable desk fan - control panel of the fan" />
      <h3 class="sub-title"> Control panel of the fan </h3>
      <div class="description">
        <p>  The control panel consists of simply two buttons and four LED lights.  All the instructions are presented beside the buttons using both Chinese and English words, and the button itself is covered with the top plastic layer, keeping dust and liquid (if you press the controls with wet hands) away from damaging the internal mechanics. </p>

    <div class="wrapper">
        <img class="photo" src="../img/object3-4-c1.jpg" alt="portable desk fan - base of the fan" />
      <h3 class="sub-title"> Base of the fan </h3>
      <div class="description">
        <p> There are four plastic pins under the base for keeping the fan steady on the surface.  Instead of keeping some distance from the edge, all the pins are located near the edge of the base, I believe this design allows the fan to better withstand the force user imposes on it while adjusting its angle.  The pins also have a little hole on it, hiding the screws out of sight and possibly making it easier for us to take off the bottom cover when using a screwdriver. </p>

      <img class="photo" src="../img/object3-5-c1.jpg" alt="portable desk fan - USB charging port" />
      <h3 class="sub-title"> USB charging port </h3>
      <div class="description">
        <p> This portable fan is designed to be used with rechargeable batteries pair with a USB charging port.  This design helps reduce battery waste ending up in the landfill and makes it easier for users to keep the fan functioning.   </p>

      <h3 class="sub-title"> Safety measure </h3>
      <div class="description">
        <p> As you can see from the picture above, the gap of the case is tight enough for keeping our fingers from reaching in.  I have tested it with my little finger as well, and I do think the case is capable of preventing accidents of such happening.  There is also a second layer of protection shown - plastic fan blades with rounded and thicker edges. </p>
