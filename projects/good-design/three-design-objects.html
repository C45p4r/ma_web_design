      <div class="curvedText">
        <p> Have you ever wondered why most chairs have four legs instead of three or five? This question is quite simple to many of us, but if we look further into the details and reasons behind it, having four legs comes with a specific reason. </p>
        <p> Learning is like observing the design of the chair, we should not use to accept pieces of information delivered
        to us without "thinking". Stay curious, ask questions, explore and create new things! </p>
      </div>
        <p> Constantly being critical of things is one of the essential skills for being a "designer" or simply alive,
        not only trying to understand the thought process behind the design but also think of possible improvement </p>
        <p> Here are some of my observations on three well-designed objects :D </p>
