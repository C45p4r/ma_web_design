        <h3 class="sub-title"> General description </h3>
        <div class="description">
          <p> The kettle shown in the photo above is light and foldable travel kettle of mine. It has a lid with three concaves on top, two for firm gripping, one for fitting in the handle when folding.  And there is an adjustable handle that automatically locks itself when placing it down. </p> <p>There is also a flexible and durable body made of half-transparent plastics.Lastly, there is a plastic-covered bottom with the switches and where the detachable cable is located.  </p>

        <img class="photo" src="img/object1-2-c1.jpg" alt="traval kettle - folded form" />
        <h3 class="sub-title"> Folded form </h3>
          <div class="description">
            <p> As you can observe through the image above, the kettle could be folded to a much shorter form with all its plastic middle-part collapsed, leaving only the top and the bottom part closely locked together.  The handle will act as a lock while pressed down towards the lit, fitting itself to the canvas mentioned earlier.  This design is perfect for saving space for other laggages while going on a vacation. </p>

      <div class="wrapper">
        <img class="photo" src="img/object1-3-c1.jpg" alt="traval kettle - the lid with serval inner layers" />
        <h3 class="sub-title"> Lid with layers </h3>
          <div class="description">
            <p> There are serval edges (or layers) under the lid, the first edge is made of harder plastics for fixing the lid to the kettle, and the second one is made of softer plastics to prevent water from spilling out. And there is also a metal layer under the lid for keeping the kettle warm (or when itâ€™s heating up). </p>

      <div class="wrapper">
        <img class="photo" src="img/object1-4-c1.jpg" alt="traval kettle - adjustable handle" />
        <h3 class="sub-title"> Adjustable handle </h3>
          <div class="description">
            <p> When the handle is being flipped over (to the position for pouring water), it will be locked in a 45-degree angle which you can pick up the kettle easily, even when it is tilted slightly when pouring water. Not only its position, but the rounded edge near the connecting part also helps provide firm-gripping as you can place your thumb over it, with other fingers around the slight-curved surface under it. </p>

      <div class="wrapper">
        <img class="photo" src="img/object1-5-c1.jpg" alt="traval kettle - traval kettle - heavy base" />
        <h3 class="sub-title"> Heavy base </h3>
          <div class="description">
            <p> The base has a heavier frustum, together with four tiny plastic pins under it. All the above helps the kettle steady steadily on the table.  There are actually two more concaves under the base, it helps when we are trying to pull the kettle back up to its extended form. </p>

        <img class="photo" src="img/object1-6-c1.jpg" alt="traval kettle - the detachable cable" />
        <h3 class="sub-title"> Detachable cable </h3>
          <div class="description">
            <p> Before mentioning details of the cable, the fact that the cable is detachable has made this kettle more portable.  As for its design, the cable is covered with plastic cover which has a non-slippy surface, with the large plugs on both ends user can insert or pull out the cable at ease. </p>
