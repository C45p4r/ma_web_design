        <h3 class="sub-title"> General description </h3>
        <div class="description">
          <p> This is a simple stainless-steel thermos with a detachable lid which I found it quite useful and nice-looking.  But this time I have got a few more details that explain why I consider this coffee themos is a good-designed one: </p>

      <div class="wrapper">
        <img class="photo" src="img/object2-2-c1.jpg" alt="coffee themos - safely measures" />
        <h3 class="sub-title"> Safely measures </h3>
        <div class="description">
          <p> Other than that, I would say the lid of the bottle is also well-designed in a way that helps us consume the hot drink more safely and easily. As you can observe from the picture, the mouth of the bottle has a protruding shape which we can fit our mouth (lips). </p> <p> And as you further observe from the picture, there is also a small indentation within the tall protruding mouth. I believe that a small indentation would give us better control over how much we would like to drink at once. </p>

      <div class="wrapper">
        <img class="photo" src="img/object2-3-c1.jpg" alt="coffee themos - lock of the bottle" />
        <h3 class="sub-title"> Lock of the bottle </h3>
        <div class="description">
          <p> There are two separate locks on the lid, one can be flipped, the other can be pressed, this double lock design can better aviod accidential pouring of liquid.  The flipping part as well as the botton on the lock have small shape design that helps user to pick and press the lock without much force.   </p>

      <div class="wrapper">
        <img class="photo" src="img/object2-4-c1.jpg" alt="coffee themos - base of the bottle" />
        <h3 class="sub-title"> Base of the bottle </h3>
        <div class="description">
          <p> Despite having no little pins nor a plastic base that "sticks" the bottle to the surface, the rounded convex with a much heavier base still keeps the bottle steady on the table most of the time. </p> <p> Other than that, as the base is the heaviest part of the bottle and the gripping part of the bottle is on the upper part, we can check how much liquid is in the bottle by simply slightly sharking the bottle (I don't know is it intended or not). </p>
