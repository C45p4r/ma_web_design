                <h3>Why this piece of literature?</h3>
                  <p>I am never an English book lover, they are often filled with fantasy words and sentences which stop me from enjoying the book itself. (I am not very good at English back then) This book surprised me when I first come through during my high school period.</p><p>I can't stop flipping through pages until the story had finally ended. The story is just too enjoyable, and meaningful at the same time, I have rethought so much in my life.</p><p>I have learned so much from this book, and I would recommend<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Five-People-You-Meet-Heaven/dp/1401308589">this book</a> to others.</p>

                <h3>Colour theme</h3>
                    <p>I have try to recreate the <a href="references/book-cover.png">cover of the book</a>by picking the three main colors out of it. Simply download the image of the book cover (the colorful version) on the net and identify those colors by using the color picker tool in PhotoShop.</p><p>I really like the <a href="references/colour-theme-v1.png">combination of colours</a>namely, night blue, sharp red, and light yellow. By putting them together, a dark background with light-color text and border, it just looks similar to the actual cover of the book.</p>

                <h3>Typography</h3>
                    <p>I have started with downloading some of the <a href="https://www.1001fonts.com/google-web-fonts.html">google web fonts</a>&nbsp;that best fit the theme of the book cover. Next, I have further built up my font stack for both serif and sans-serif fonts by choosing some of the web-safe fonts. While using a special font for the book title</p><p>Taking different screen sizes into consideration, font size of the text will be adjusted with the increasing viewpoint.</p>

                <h3>Start with mobile</h3>
                <p>Instead of following my habit of opening up a webpage on my laptop to preview the output of my code (start with big screen), I have tried to use the <a href="references/screenshot-01.png">Responsively app.</a>&nbsp;By doing so, I can ensure users can view the page normally even they are using small screens.</p><p>
                And by creating breakpoints with the media queries, the user's experience could be enhanced with a self-adjusting style for the page.</p>
