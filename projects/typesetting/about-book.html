        <h2>~&nbsp;&nbsp;About the Book&nbsp;&nbsp;~</h2>
        <p>"All endings are also beginnings.  We just don't know it at the time..."</p>
        <p>On his eighty-third birthday, Eddie, a lonely war veteran, dies in a tragic accident trying to save a little girl from a falling cart.</p><p>With his final breath, he feels two small hands in his - and then nothing.  He awakens in the afterlife, where he learns that heaven is not a lush Garden of Eden but a place where your earthly life is explained to you by five people who were in it.</p><p></p><p>These people may have been loved ones or distant strangers.  Yet each of them changed your path forever.</p><p>One by one, from childhood to soldier to old age, Eddie's five people revisit their connections to him on earth, illuminating the mysteries of his "meaningless" life, and revealing the haunting secret behind the eternal question: "Why was I here?"</p>
